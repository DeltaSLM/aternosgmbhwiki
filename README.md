#### exaroton

While Aternos tries to provide the best performance possible for free, [exaroton](https://exaroton.com/) is a paid service which removes a lot of restrictions. The idea is that you only pay for the time that you actually use the server and keep it offline when you don't need it. This is made easy with features like automatic starting when someone tries to join or an API.
